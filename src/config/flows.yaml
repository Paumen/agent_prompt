# Flow definitions — to be designed in a separate session.
# This file is the single source of truth for task/flow/step configuration.
# Claude implements exactly what is defined here.
#
# --- Vocabulary reference (pool for step definitions) ---
#
# Objects: repository, branch, file, folder, file tree, pull request, issue,
#   commit, PR comments, review comments, labels, diff hunks, CI status.
#
# Operations: read, create, edit, delete, rename, move, merge, split, search,
#   scan, compare, analyze, validate, commit, open (PR/issue).
#
# Focus Lenses: semantics, syntax, security, performance, structure,
#   dependencies, duplications, redundancies, error handling, naming conventions,
#   test coverage, type safety, documentation completeness, accessibility.
#
# --- Authoring guidelines ---
#
# - PR references use PR number only — don't embed diff content in the prompt.
#   The LLM has GitHub access and can fetch PR data using the number + PAT.
# - Write-oriented flows should instruct the LLM to create a new branch;
#   branch naming is left to the LLM's judgment if not specified by the user.
# - Step granularity should be moderate — assume LLM competence.
#   Don't micro-instruct what it already knows how to do.
