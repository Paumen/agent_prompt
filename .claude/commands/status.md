Check and report the current implementation status.

Steps:

1. Read the Implementation Status table at the bottom of `spec/spec_concept.md`.
2. Summarize lifecycle counts:
   - How many requirements are `To start`, `In progress`, `Testing`, `🏁 Approved`, `🚫 Blocked`.
3. Summarize test coverage:
   - How many Unit / SIT / UAT tests are `✅ passed`, `❌ failed`, `◻ pending`, `— N/A`.
4. List any `🚫 Blocked` requirements and their blockers.
5. List the next requirements that are ready to start (still `To start`, with no unresolved dependencies).
6. Note any requirements that are partially implemented (`In progress`) or in testing.
