Check and report the current implementation status.

Steps:

1. Read the Implementation Status table at the bottom of `spec/spec_concept.md`.
2. Count and summarize: how many requirements are `pending`, `implemented`, and `tested`.
3. List the next requirements that are ready to implement.
4. Note any requirements that are partially implemented or blocked.
